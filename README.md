# OutWork App

I created this app to track my workouts and view my progress over weeks/months on my phone. 

## Tech stack used
**React/JS** Front End
Stlyed using **Plain CSS/Components**
Relational DB/Auth/Backend using **Supabase**

I learned a TON on this project. It was my first one using any sort of backend. I learned to read documentation and was introduced to new concepts like RLS (Row Level Security).
Coming up with Tables, primary keys, foreign keys, and data types was something that took time to understand and decide on what would work for my app. 

I am getting much more comfortable with React. I do feel there is much room to improve from a styling standpoint. On my next Project i will use figma to have a concrete plan for what I want the app to look like.
Lastly this will be my last JS project next one will use TypeScript which I recently learned.

## Still left to implement
Testing
Dragging Exercises on a mobile device
